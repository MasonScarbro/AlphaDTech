<h4>This is a mediHacks project built in 3 days! built using Django, and HTML/CSS/JS</h6>
<br></br>
<h5>Inspiration</h5>
<p>The inspiration of this project was based upon the AlphaFold API which one of our team members discovered a few months back. While in anatomy class learning about proteins, to maximize efficiency and have correct protein structures, one of our members found AlphaFold to make protein structure models. Coming into the project, with the knowledge of the AlphaFold API, they figured it would be perfect to incorporate into a project for this health based hackathon.</p>

<h5>What it does</h5>
<p>Our web application is a tool that combines medical research with AI technology. It interacts with users easily and prompts them to enter disease names. AlphaD provides an array of protein data through its seamless connection with the AlphaFold API. This information is a vital tool for observant researchers, acting as an indicator in the huge ocean of biological knowledge. Our application enables researchers to speed up the essential task of identifying crucial proteins, therefore expanding the boundaries of medical knowledge and research. It does this by providing quick and informative access to protein information for multiple disorders.</p>

<h5>How we built it</h5>
In the development of AlphaD Technologies, we effectively used the powerful Django framework in addition to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, with the inclusion of AlphaFold API, a AI System that predicts a protein's 3D structure, and ChatGPT API, we were able to facilitate the main feature of the website, which was displaying information of given proteins.

<h5>Challenges we ran into</h5>
<p>In the course of development, our team struggled with the handling of the AlphaFold API. Analyzing their return data, we were clueless when it came to getting the model of the protein through the API. After a bit of research about different file types and urls and how to incorporate them into HTML, our teammates successfully faced our biggest challenge.</p>

<h5>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h5>
<p>A few of the many accomplishments we are proud of is the effective teamwork that was present through the period of development. Tasks were laid out and completed on time with teammates there to help when we needed. Some other accomplishments includes the finishing of the project within 24 hours of beginning and content of the quality throughout all members.</p>

<h5>What we learned</h5>
<p>Throughout the few days our team worked with each other, we all learned specific skills. Some of the mentionable skills include new css and html knowledge, the learning of different protein structures, and the use of protein data bank files, And a ton of frontend to backend communication strategies!</p>
